// friendly-labels.js — turn engineer strings into student-facing copy
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// The raw backend strings (`tier_1_distinctive`, `prestige_source:"research"`,
// factor keys like `narrative_fit`) leak internal taxonomy into the UI. This
// module centralises the mapping from those stable machine strings to
// human-readable English (and eventually Korean via the i18n layer).
//
// Keep these pure functions — no DB access, no async. The goal is that any
// API response or skill prompt that wants to show prose to the student can
// call `renderFriendlyEC(vector)` and get back a shape the frontend can
// dump straight into JSX without any local formatting logic.
//
// F11 from the Jiyeon UX audit ("engineer language → friendly labels").
