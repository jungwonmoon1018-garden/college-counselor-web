// i18n — Internationalization, AI Disclosure, & First-Gen Glossary
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Provides:
//   1. Translation strings for all UI text (en-US + ko full coverage; others stubs)
//   2. Namespaced keys for the Round 1-4 student-facing copy (friendly labels,
//      drift messages, candidate-rank messages, deadline messages, prestige
//      rationale copy, onboarding help + errors from scripts/register.js)
//   3. College admissions glossary for first-gen students
//   4. International curriculum support (IB, A-Level, CBSE)
//   5. Locale-aware formatting (dates, numbers, currency)
//   6. AI disclosure strings (Korea AI Basic Act compliance)
//   7. Output labeling strings for three-lane responses
//   8. resolveLocale(req) — picks the best locale from the request
//   9. localizeFriendlyLabels(locale) — locale-aware mirrors of friendly-labels.js
//
// F8 from the Jiyeon UX audit ("Korean students see English strings on
// student-facing surfaces"). The goal is zero untranslated strings on the
// paths a Korean 11th-grader actually reads — onboarding, narrative drift,
// candidate ranking, deadlines, prestige rationale, friendly labels.
