// DEVIL'S ADVOCATE — proposes the OPPOSITE recommendation
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Structurally takes the contrary position to force the panel to consider
// alternatives. If the Strategist proposes "switch to applied math," the
// Devil's Advocate argues for "stay with CS." If the Strategist says
// "apply ED to school X," the DA argues for "apply RD to a broader set."
// Always stance="oppose" — but its recommendation must still be grounded
// in the cited evidence.
