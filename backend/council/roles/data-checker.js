// Runs second in the explicit Council sequence using the configured mid tier
// for stronger reading comprehension. Reads the Strategist's
// recommendation (passed in via context) and the same shared subgraph,
// then flags every load-bearing claim with one of:
//   - "verified"      → backed by an EXTRACTED edge or baseline fact.
//   - "inferred"      → backed by an INFERRED graph edge (lower assurance).
//   - "ambiguous"     → AMBIGUOUS graph edge or no clear backing.
//   - "fabricated"    → claim has no trace in the shared context.
//
// The moderator treats "fabricated" as a soft veto — recommendations
// with any fabricated claim cannot consensus-pass without re-deliberation.
