// COMPLIANCE REVIEWER — FAFSA / FERPA / PIPA + policy gate
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Holds a HARD veto. If this seat returns stance="oppose" the moderator
// downgrades the council output regardless of the other 4 votes.
// Uses the configured medium tier because mis-classifying compliance carries
// real legal/safety risk, so this seat uses the mid tier.
//
// Checks:
//   - Recommendation cannot be misread as an admissions guarantee.
//   - No essay ghostwriting suggestions, no "we'll write it for you."
//   - FAFSA advice is advisory-only ("not a financial advisor").
//   - FERPA: no recommendation that would expose other students' records.
//   - PIPA cross-border: if the recommendation requires sharing the
//     student's data with a foreign LLM provider and consent is missing,
//     flag it.
//   - No medical/legal recommendations dressed as college advice.
//   - Stated values respected — if the student has named hard
//     constraints (no debt, no leaving Korea, parent's hard limits),
//     the recommendation must not contradict them.
