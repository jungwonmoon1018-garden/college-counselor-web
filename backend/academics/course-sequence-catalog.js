// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// COURSE SEQUENCE CATALOG — major-aligned reference course ladders
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// A static, auditable reference of the courses that a coherent transcript
// for a given major bucket typically demonstrates, ordered foundational →
// advanced. This is the qualitative companion to the AP-concept mastery
// vectors: where ap-concept-vectorizer.js tells us how deeply a student
// understands a subject they've taken, this catalog tells us which courses
// a major-aligned student is *expected* to have on the transcript at all.
//
// DESIGN CONSTRAINTS (mirrors competition-research.js OFFICIAL_* tables and
// ap-concept-catalog.js):
//   • Bucket keys MUST match positioning-engine.js MAJOR_DEMAND_BASE /
//     ec-vectorizer.js matchMajorBucket output, so the same major resolves
//     to the same ladder everywhere in the app.
//   • Each course carries `match` keywords used to detect whether the
//     student already has it on their transcript (lowercased substring).
//   • `apSubject` ties a course to an AP_* subject id from
//     ap-concept-catalog.js so the recommender can pull concept-level
//     mastery / gap signals. null = no direct AP analog.
//   • `level`: foundational → core → advanced → recommended. The first
//     three form the spine; `recommended` courses strengthen the spike but
//     are not strictly expected.
//   • `why`: a one-line, major-specific rationale. This is COACHING/
//     INFERENCE content — never presented as a verified requirement unless
//     a cited school expectation backs it (see server.js lane assignment).
//
// This catalog encodes typical US high-school → selective-admit
// expectations. It is intentionally conservative and small; extend it
// rather than letting the model invent sequences at runtime.
